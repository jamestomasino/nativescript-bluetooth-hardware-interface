# Nativescript <- Bluetooth -> Hardware Interface

## Overview

The NativeScript Bluetooth Hardware Interface (NBHI) is a plan to
build a platform for communicating between a micro-sized hardware
device and a nativescript application.

## Implementation Plan

Effectively build a circuit that can translate digital and analog
inputs from components via bluetooth to a nativescript application.
Minimize the footprint by printing a PCB, soldering components, and
translating the arduino controller to an ATTiny85. Author an npm 
library for parsing the serial communication from our hardware. 
Implement bluetooth connectivity via nativescript to connect to our 
hardware. Adjust something on screen based on hardware inputs.
